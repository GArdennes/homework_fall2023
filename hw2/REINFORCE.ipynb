    "# REINFORCE ALGORITHM\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement the Reinforce algorithm also known as the Monte Carlo Policy Gradient. To test its robustness, we would train it in a simple environment e.g. Cartpole-v1. The simple environment is chosen to be sure that the algorithm works before going deeper. Since finding bugs would be much easier in simple environments. This implementation is based on [Hugging Face Deep RL Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit4/introduction).\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Reinforce is a Policy-based method i.e. a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that tries to optimize the policy directly without using an action-value function. More precisely, Reinforce is a Policy-gradient method, a subclass of Policy-based methods that aims to optimize the policy directly by estimating the weights of the optimal policy using gradient ascent. A policy is generated directly from the state-value function. The policy gradient algorithms search for a local maximum in the state value function by ascending the gradient of the policy w.r.t the parameters."

    "> A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless traack. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart. The goal is to push the cart left or right **so that the pole stays in the equilibruim**\n",
